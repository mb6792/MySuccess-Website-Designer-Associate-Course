        <h4>JavaScript Frameworks in 2020</h4>
        <p>
          It's 2020 and the JavaScript<br />
          train doesn't look like its about to slow down any time soon. As
          JavaScript evolves, the frameworks that go with it keep popping up and
          changing at at an amazing pace. Within three months, a framework can
          go from something nobody's ever heard of to the hottest new thing,
          only to be forgotten as soon as the next big thing comes along.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's look at some of this year's most popular JavaScript frameworks:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Angular</li>
          <li>Backbone.js</li>
          <li>Ember</li>
          <li>React</li>
          <li>Vue</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          You should really take a look at the <em>big five</em> frameworks, and
          choose the one that best suits your needs. Personally, I'm using
          <strong>React</strong> quite a bit these days, as I find it provides
          just enough tools to get a project started without overwhelming me
          with built-in stuff. Here's how easy it is to create a simple React
          page:
        </p>
        <pre>
            ReactDOM.render(
                &lt;h1&lt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;,
                document.getElementById('root')
            );
        </pre>
